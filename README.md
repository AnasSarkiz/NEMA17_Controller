# NEMA14 CH32X035G8U6 controller — v1.7.0 prototype

A **35 × 35 × 1.6 mm**, four-layer controller with native JLCPCB parts, two USB-C ports on one edge and a fitted JST PH motor connector. The board includes the reference power/debug LED, RGB status LED, TMP102 temperature sensor and PWM magnetic buzzer. USB-C and JST physical-pin roles match Rishabh’s reference, with board-specific MCU GPIOs documented in [reference feedback](docs/reference-feedback.md).

This revision moves or rotates 11 resistors to improve clearance on all four edges. Every resistor pad targets at least **0.75 mm** to the board edge, with all resistor values and pin-to-net assignments retained. Actual native JSON/Gerber evidence is in [resistor edge clearance](docs/resistor-edge-clearance.md).

Four Ø3.2 mm mounting holes remain exactly (±13, ±13). The same-edge USB layout is screened for two 12 mm plug housings and M3 DIN 920 screw heads ≤Ø4 mm. Native STEP screening passes the defined envelopes. **Rear mounting compatibility remains unverified.**

The motor driver retains its 0.351 A nominal limit, reset defaults and 1/16 microstep configuration. Power USB-C requests 15 V through CH224K; programming USB-C supplies fixed 5 V and full-speed USB data, with independent CC pull-downs and USB ESD protection. Logic power uses the AP63203 3.3 V buck regulator.

This is **not a manufacturing release**. Electrical/copper verification, actual drill coordinates and mechanical evidence are recorded in [current verification](docs/mounting-usb-verification.md). Assembly/stencil findings, firmware, bench tests and the complete motor mounting assembly remain unqualified. A reference board working does not prove this layout or its firmware has been physically validated.

The CH32 revision now uses four layers and the buck regulator to accommodate the feedback circuitry and buzzer load; manufacturing cost differs from the prior two-layer revision. TMP102 uses software I2C on PB7/PB6, preserving USB and WCH debugging.

The schematic follows the reference’s functional grouping in **five connected A4 sheets**: power/PD, programming USB, controller, motor driver, and temperature/feedback. Native schematic analysis reports zero issues. Independent wire-geometry analysis verifies all 241 physical pins, named cross-sheet nets, explicit NC marks and wire junctions.

Useful commands: `npm run source:check`, `npm run check`, `npm run export`, `npm run check:mounts`, `npm run check:copper`, and `npm run publish:tscircuit`. Publishing is gated by current qualification receipts and independent CAM copper checks. Saved routing is delivered in `index.circuit.json`; `index.circuit.tsx` and `src/board.tsx` retain the editable circuit source.
