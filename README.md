# NEMA14_CH32X035G8U6

Service revision for STEPperONLINE14HM11-0404S,35×35mmPCB,topcomponentassembly,twocopperlayers. **Hardware qualification remains unperformed.**

- Two USB-C mouths face+Y,14mm pitch,0.4mm beyondPCB. PD requests15V; DATA is computerUSB. Selected Tensility cables and hostbend/access envelopes are documented.
- Keyed JSTB4B-PH-K-S(LF)(SN) /PHR-4 motor harness:1BlackA+,2GreenA−,3RedB+,4BlueB−. Includes restrained BeldenAWG24 extensions, service loop and captured insulating barrier. Factory lead/splice/material qualification remains pending.
- Enlarged front-M3 carrier uses the motor's documentedthreads; rearendcapscrews untouched. UpperPCBholes29.6mm/lower26mm pitch are carrier mounts.
- Panasonic bulk nominalCAD corrected to7.7±0.3mm with8.3mm maximumassembly allowance and originalsupplierassets retained.

Fabrication requires filled/copper-capped specified SMT vias and supplier placementpreview acceptance. Current, USB/PD, sequencing,regeneration,mountedtemperature and physicalfit are unperformed hardware tests; passingsoftware/CAM does not make this production ready.
