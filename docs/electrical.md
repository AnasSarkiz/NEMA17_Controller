# Electrical design review

A4988 VREF = 3.3 × 10/(39+10) = 0.6735 V; Itrip = VREF/(8 × 0.24) = 0.3508 A. The native 0.24 Ω, 1%, 125 mW resistors dissipate about 29.5 mW nominally. A deliberately expanded 3.465 V rail budget, 1% resistor bounds and a provisional 5% driver allowance estimate 0.3969 A. This is an engineering budget, not a qualified maximum: the actual driver accuracy, ground bounce and sense-track resistance must be measured. The SMF18A clamp still requires regenerative-energy testing.



## Copper review, 2026-10-07

The checked saved layout, rather than nominal JSX settings, was reviewed. Power/motor tracks were widened only when exact imported pad, via and foreign-track geometry retained at least 0.15 mm clearance. Their centerlines were retained. `artifacts/power-copper-adjustments.json` records each width change; `supplier-routing-adjustments.json` replays the complete result from the saved SES import. Ground pours have 0.20 mm clearance, 0.35 mm edge margin, and no unconnected islands. Components remain top-side assembled.

| Copper | Actual saved width / review |
| --- | --- |
| Motor outputs / sense | About 0.28–0.45 mm, including package escapes; screened at 0.40 A peak |
| PD motor supply | 0.30–0.60 mm; 0.75 A input budget, with a verified single-bridge RP2040 branch screened at 0.40 A |
| Logic supply / switching node | Widened where possible; package escapes remain as small as 0.16 mm; 0.15 A rail / 0.20 A switching budget |
| Ground | 0.16–0.45 mm tracks plus filled ground copper; parallel plane paths must be considered, rather than assuming the entire motor return flows down every ground stub |
| USB / other signals | 0.16 mm; width alone does not establish differential impedance or signal integrity |

Copper screening requires **at least 35 μm finished external copper and 17.5 μm internal copper** where applicable, on 1.6 mm FR-4, with at least 20 μm via barrel plating. These are fabrication requirements, not measurements of a manufactured PCB. IPC-2221 equations use k=0.048 externally and 0.024 internally, with a 30 °C rise screening limit. The report includes each actual segment, layer, current budget and temperature estimate. This approximate method does not model enclosure/motor heating, neck heat spreading, switching pulses, vias or ground-plane current sharing.

The largest isolated non-ground trace estimate is 5.2 °C at its assigned budget. Ground traces covered by the same-net pour are explicitly reported as parallel paths; their isolated-track estimate is not a prediction of actual plane temperature. Ground current sharing and regulator/driver temperatures remain bench checks.


## Voltage sensing correction

R_VM_H/R_VM_L is now **100 kΩ/10 kΩ**, replacing 100 kΩ/22 kΩ. It produces 1.364 V at 15 V; the worst resistor-tolerance value is 3.240 V at a 35 V review envelope. The old divider produced 3.606 V at only 20 V, before tolerance, so motor regeneration could overstress the ADC input. This change reuses JLCPCB C25804 and its unchanged native footprint. **Firmware must multiply VM_SENSE voltage by 11**, with calibration as needed. The 35 V arithmetic envelope is not approval to operate the motor bus at 35 V; the intended supply remains 15 V. Rails, TVS energy and component ratings require transient testing.

## Operation review and remaining tests

CH224K requests 15 V with CFG1/2/3 = 0/1/1; PG is active low. A supply must advertise the requested PDO. Driver ENABLE_N has a pull-up, SLEEP has a pull-down, and firmware must keep the bridge disabled until PG and measured VM are valid. Diode ORing separates host VBUS from PD while permitting logic-only USB power. USB/data ground is shared with motor power.

USB programming entry is wired: WCH ROM ISP through PC17/D+ at cold power-up on CH32; RP2040 ROM USB boot through the flash-CS boot jumper and RUN/reset. This has not been demonstrated on physical hardware. USB routes were checked for continuity and shorts, but were not impedance-qualified or accepted as a length-matched differential pair. Reported per-net copper totals contain connector/ESD branches and must not be interpreted as pair skew. Host-only, PD-only and simultaneous-cable tests, both Type-C orientations, repeated enumeration and actual flashing are required.

At first bring-up, keep the motor disconnected, power through a current-limited source, check all rails and confirm disabled outputs. Then verify 15 V PD negotiation/fallback behavior and absence of host backfeed. Measure 3.3 V ripple and load-step response (plus RP2040 1.1 V and crystal startup), flash over USB, measure both phase currents and sense offsets, and exercise stalled/accelerating/stopping motor cases while watching VM overshoot and driver/regulator temperatures. Test at the intended motor/enclosure temperature. The CH32 linear regulator dissipates roughly (14.6−3.3)×I_logic, or about 0.34 W at 30 mA; the 100 mA part rating alone is not a thermal guarantee. The RP2040 buck's switching/input loop and feedback placement require ripple/stability validation.

No motor-control firmware is present. Rear mounting remains unverified because the motor drawing dimensions only the front face. Manufacturer-level A4988 accuracy, CH224K/HT7533 electrical limits and component transient ratings remain purchasing/release checks; direct manufacturer document retrieval was blocked in this environment. Existing pin/reference and supplier evidence is recorded in `docs/sources.md`. **Manufacturing release remains blocked.**
