# Current mounting, connector and copper verification

This is the v1.7.0 **hardware prototype**, not a manufacturing release. The historical v1.4 evidence is in [history](history/v1.4-mounting-usb-verification.md).

Board SHA-256: `4d3b1d4ca24870283fd553df674e9910775ece133c28864042268364bd4f4af9`. Saved copper: 420 traces, 193 plated vias and 36 ground regions. Native DRC reports 0 errors and 0 warnings. Independent Circuit JSON geometry checks 50 nets, with 0 disconnected nets. Independent parsing of the actual current Gerbers reports 0 opens and 0 shorts.

The all-edge resistor audit checks 23 resistors / 46 actual Gerber flashes. Minimum measured nominal pad-to-edge clearance is **0.753 mm**. See [resistor edge clearance](resistor-edge-clearance.md).

The PCB remains **35 × 35 × 1.6 mm**, four layers. Source, saved JSON and actual native Gerber Excellon agree on exactly **Ø3.2 mm NPTH at (±13, ±13)**. The actual drill member is `drill_npth.drl`; its SHA-256 is `014c50469b18c0c9451d2781b9a083ee12655717153f358bb0df49fd12e64724`.

Both native USB-C mouths remain on +Y at X=±6.2 mm, Y=17.5 mm, with 12.4 mm pitch. Native STEP screening of 61 fitted models passes with the defined two 12 × 30 × 7 mm cable envelopes and Ø4.4 mm head envelopes. This requires **M3 DIN 920 heads ≤Ø4 mm**, with no unverified larger washer/head. Cable envelopes are procurement bounds, not tested cable samples. The native JST PH C131334 connector remains top-entry, with physical pins 1 A+, 2 A−, 3 B+, 4 B−. Connector physical pins and all reference feedback pins pass the independent source review.

Rear-motor compatibility is **unverified**. The available motor drawing establishes its front mounting pattern; it does not qualify a rear adapter, screw engagement, spacer or complete tolerance stack. JST tails extend below the PCB. All bottom-side clearances require a real mounting assembly review.

Native placement suggestions remain visible in their log; their nonzero advisory result is not described as a blanket PASS. Complete independent CAM remains FAIL for the assembly findings below. Prototype publication accepts those disclosed assembly findings only after all electrical, copper, drill and mechanical checks pass. The publisher rejects actual CAM opens, shorts, copper-spacing failures, unassigned copper and stale evidence.

## Remaining release blockers

- BOM-source-identity
- EP-stencil-coverage
- assembly-paste-policy
- assembly-table-policy
- paste-source-mismatch
- silkscreen-clearance
- stencil-release-screen

The generated assembly tables, passive orientations, bare-pad BOM/paste treatment, exposed-pad stencil coverage, stencil release and silkscreen need manufacturer review before ordering assembly. Firmware must implement the temperature polling/alarm policy, RGB GPIOs and PWM buzzer. No assembled hardware, USB/PD bench test, phase-current measurement, thermal run or rear-motor fit has been qualified. A generated Gerber archive is not manufacturing approval.

See [reference components and wiring](reference-feedback.md), `artifacts/resume-validation.json`, `artifacts/reference-feedback/every-trace-review.csv`, `artifacts/trace-width-review.json` and `artifacts/manufacturing/audit.json` for the actual evidence and limits.
