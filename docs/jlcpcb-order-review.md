# NEMA14_CH32X035G8U6: JLCPCB engineering review

This handoff is prepared for order review. It is not JLCPCB approval or a production release. No order or payment has been submitted.

Upload `JLCPCB-Gerbers.zip` for the PCB, `JLCPCB-BOM.csv` and `JLCPCB-CPL.csv` for SMT assembly. The BOM contains exact source MPNs and LCSC part numbers. The raw native export is retained separately as historical evidence and must not replace this corrected package. `review-cam.zip` contains the exact CAM and detailed source-identity tables used by the independent audit.

Select 4 layers, 35 × 35 mm, 1.6 mm board thickness, and ENIG for the bare debug/boot contacts. Request at least 35 um outer copper, 17.5 um inner copper and 20 um plated via barrels. Copper layer order is F_Cu / In1_Cu / In2_Cu / B_Cu. Both drill files are required: plated drills/slots and NPTH. The four mounting holes are Ø3.2 mm at (±13, ±13), with board-center origin.

The 100 um stencil has independently screened fine-pitch apertures and four windows totaling 60% exposed-pad coverage for the MCU, PD controller and A4988. `Thermal-Via-Process.csv` identifies the actual exposed-pad via positions and drill sizes that require filling, copper capping and planarization. Confirm the supplier's paste/reflow and via-in-pad processes before releasing assembly; these capabilities and costs have not been quoted.

SMT fitted parts: 60. Bottom SMT references: none. Bare `J_BOOT` and `J_DEBUG` have no purchased component or stencil paste. JST `J_MOTOR` is native B4B-PH-K-S(LF)(SN), C131334, and is excluded from SMT pickup files. Use `Manual-THT-BOM.csv` for hand soldering or ask the supplier to quote a secondary THT operation. The functional order is pin 1 A+, 2 A−, 3 B+, 4 B−. The JST mates vertically from +Z.

CPL coordinates are millimeters about board center, unmirrored board XY for both sides. Rotation is the native imported footprint orientation plus component placement rotation. **Check every polarized part and pin 1 in JLCPCB's placement preview.** `placement-orientation-review.json` lists each actual numbered pad, center, side and rotation; source agreement is not proof of supplier pickup convention. For both USB connectors the imported land-pattern center differs from the body-bounding-box center by 0.975 mm along the mouth axis. Do not silently substitute the body center as the pickup datum.

The preview images show actual corrected mask and silkscreen Gerbers, not the native CAD captions. Dense silkscreen omits captions that cannot fit safely; all fitted references remain in the assembly maps and placement tables. Inspect assembly maps together with the pad-orientation manifest.

Software verification covers source nets, all saved traces/segments/vias, physical connectivity, actual CAM shorts/opens and clearance, pad/mask/drill agreement, stencil geometry, assembly identities, exact outline and mounts, and nominal native STEP mechanical checks. **USB impedance/reference paths, switching loops, sense/ground return behavior, firmware and thermal performance still require engineering and hardware validation.** A working reference board does not prove this implementation works.

Both USB mouths share the +Y edge, with defined 12 mm plug envelopes. Use M3 DIN 920 screw heads no larger than Ø4 mm. Cable/screw screening is nominal CAD evidence. Verify real plug tolerances, JST tails, underside clearance and the mounting stack. Rear-motor compatibility has not been verified.

Supplier review still must confirm exact stock and quote, pickup orientation, via-in-pad and stencil/reflow process, specified stackup/copper, and assembly sides/THT plan. Do not authorize substitutes. Prototype bring-up must verify USB data, 15 V PD, regulator isolation, phase current/thermal behavior, motor, temperature sensor, LEDs and buzzer before production approval.

Strict generic Circuit JSON importers retain inherited metadata compatibility findings, listed in `native-json-compatibility.json`: display offsets stored as numbers instead of strings, null optional ownership, and a generic buzzer source record. Native rendering, physical coordinates and pin/net checks pass; the order package introduces no schema findings and every new paste aperture passes its native schema. No whole-file generic-schema PASS is claimed. These metadata fields do not determine the fabrication or placement coordinates.

Board source SHA-256: `0d6bb9068420a252c1bdadd10bf04adc065387ea5682b4affff6f25cddec5ac0`. Corrected CAM audit: PASS, zero findings. Electrical source, placement, native footprints/courtyards, copper, masks, drills and outline are preserved.
